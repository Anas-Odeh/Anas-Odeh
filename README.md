## **Welcome** 



My journey into the world of biomedical science began not in a lab, but from a deeply personal quest. On a day that remains etched in my memory, November 13th, 2012, I confronted my own genetic enigma, leading to the discovery that I had Becker Muscular Dystrophy. This pivotal moment wasn't just a diagnosis; it was the first step on a path filled with relentless curiosity and a determination to pierce the veil of muscular dystrophies, particularly Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

The quest was never just academic; it was as personal as it was scientific. Diving into the realms of deep learning and machine analysis, I wasn't just looking at data points or algorithms; I saw potential keys to unlock the complex puzzles of biological systems that many, including myself, are intricately part of. My approach isn't merely about applying advanced technologies; it's about weaving the power of artificial intelligence into the very fabric of muscular dystrophy research to illuminate the shadowy recesses of these conditions.

The challenges muscular dystrophies present are monumental, yet they only serve to sharpen my resolve. My ambition stretches beyond academic accolades; it's about forging tools that offer not just insights but hopeâ€”diagnostic innovations, therapeutic breakthroughs, and, ultimately, a tangible enhancement in the lives of those shadowed by these conditions.

My narrative isn't just a chronicle of personal and scientific exploration. It's a testament to the resilience and boundless curiosity that drive me, a beacon for others navigating the tumultuous seas of research. Through my dedication to demystifying muscular dystrophies, I aim not only to be recognized as a researcher but as a harbinger of hope and change for those ensnared by these complex conditions.
